Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

A paramount question is what effect higher-order interactions beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange have on the magnetic properties of few-atom thick compounds. Here we demonstrate that biquadratic exchange interactions, which is the simplest and most natural form of non-Heisenberg coupling, assume a key role in the magnetic properties of layered magnets. Using a combination of nonperturbative analytical techniques, non-collinear first-principles methods and classical Monte Carlo calculations that incorporate higher-order exchange, we show that several quantities including magnetic anisotropies, spin-wave gaps and topological spin-excitations are intrinsically renormalized leading to further thermal stability of the layers. We develop a spin Hamiltonian that also contains antisymmetric exchanges (e.g., Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interactions) to successfully rationalize numerous observations, such as the non-Ising character of several compounds despite a strong magnetic anisotropy, peculiarities of the magnon spectrum of 2D magnets, and the discrepancy between measured and calculated Curie temperatures. Our results provide a theoretical framework for the exploration of different physical phenomena in 2D magnets where biquadratic exchange interactions have an important contribution.},

  abstract = {JAX and PyTorch are two popular Python autodifferentiation frameworks. JAX is based around pure functions and functional programming. PyTorch has popularised the use of an object-oriented (OO) class-based syntax for defining parameterised functions, such as neural networks. That this seems like a fundamental difference means current libraries for building parameterised functions in JAX have either rejected the OO approach entirely (Stax) or have introduced OO-to-functional transformations, multiple new abstractions, and been limited in the extent to which they integrate with JAX (Flax, Haiku, Objax). Either way this OO/functional difference has been a source of tension. Here, we introduce `Equinox', a small neural network library showing how a PyTorch-like class-based approach may be admitted without sacrificing JAX-like functional programming. We provide two main ideas. One: parameterised functions are themselves represented as `PyTrees', which means that the parameterisation of a function is transparent to the JAX framework. Two: we filter a PyTree to isolate just those components that should be treated when transforming (`jit', `grad' or `vmap'-ing) a higher-order function of a parameterised function -- such as a loss function applied to a model. Overall Equinox resolves the above tension without introducing any new programmatic abstractions: only PyTrees and transformations, just as with regular JAX. Equinox is available at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox\}.},

It is well known that in Ising models hyperscaling breaks down above the upper critical dimension. It was shown by Schwartz (1991) that the standard Josephson hyperscaling rule can also break down in Ising systems with quenched random interactions. A related Renormalization Group Theory hyperscaling rule links the critical exponents for the normalized Binder cumulant and the correlation length in the thermodynamic limit. An appropriate scaling approach for analyzing measurements from criticality to infinite temperature is first outlined. Numerical data on the scaling of the normalized correlation length and the normalized Binder cumulant are shown for the canonical Ising ferromagnet model in dimension three where hyperscaling holds, for the Ising ferromagnet in dimension five (so above the upper critical dimension) where hyperscaling breaks down, and then for Ising spin glass models in dimension three where the quenched interactions are random. For the Ising spin glasses there is a breakdown of the normalized Binder cumulant hyperscaling relation in the thermodynamic limit regime, with a return to size independent Binder cumulant values in the finite-size scaling regime around the critical region.},

There are analytic solutions for low dimensions and very efficient Monte Carlo methods, such as cluster algorithms, for simulating this model in special cases. However most approaches do not generalise to arbitrary lattices and couplings. We present a formalism that allows one to apply Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulations to the Ising model, demonstrating how a system with discrete degrees of freedom can be simulated with continuous variables. Because of the flexibility of HMC, our formalism is easily generalizable to arbitrary modifications of the model, creating a route to leverage advanced algorithms such as shift preconditioners and multi-level methods, developed in conjunction with HMC.},

An implementation of the three dimensional ferromagnetic cubic lattice Ising model on a GPU is able to generate results up to 35 times faster than on a current CPU core. As proof of concept we calculate the critical temperature of the 2D and 3D Ising model using finite size scaling techniques.

MF solutions of the spin-1 Blume-Capel (BC) model and the mixed-spin Ising model demonstrate a change of continuous phase transitions to discontinuous ones at a tricritical point. A quantum phase transition of the spin-S Ising model driven by a transverse field is explored within MF method. EF theory is elaborated within a single- and two-spin cluster approach to demonstrate an efficiency of this approximate method. The long-standing problem of this method concerned with a self-consistent determination of the free energy is addressed. EF theory is adapted for the spin-1/2 Ising model, the spin-S BC model and the transverse Ising model. The particular attention is paid to continuous and discontinuous transitions. Exact results for the spin-1/2 Ising chain, spin-1 BC chain and mixed-spin Ising chain are obtained using the transfer-matrix method, the crucial steps of which are reviewed for a spin-1/2 Ising square lattice. Critical points of the spin-1/2 Ising model on several lattices are rigorously obtained with the help of dual, star-triangle and decoration-iteration transformations. Mapping transformations are adapted to obtain exact results for the mixed-spin Ising model on planar lattices. An increase in the coordination number of the mixed-spin Ising model on decorated planar lattices gives rise to reentrant transitions, while the critical temperature of the mixed-spin Ising model on a regular honeycomb lattice is always greater than that of two semi-regular archimedean lattices. The effect of selective site dilution of the mixed-spin Ising model on a honeycomb lattice upon phase diagrams is examined. The review affords a brief account of the Ising models solved within MF, EF and exact methods along with a few comments on their future applicability.},

Within this analysis, we discuss the critical behavior of one-, two- and three-dimensional systems modeled by the first-neighbor spin-1 Ising model for different types of exchange interactions. The comparison of the results obtained according the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations allows us to highlight the limits of the widely used mean-field theory approach. We also show, via a simple transformation, that for the special case where the bilinear and bicubic terms are set equal to zero in the Hamiltonian the partition function of the spin-1 Ising model can be reduced to that of the spin-1/2 Ising model with temperature dependent external field and temperature independent exchange interaction times an exponential factor depending on the other terms of the Hamiltonian and confirm this result numerically by using the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we investigate the dependence of the critical temperature on the strength of long-range interactions included in the Ising Hamiltonian comparing it with that of the first-neighbor spin-1/2 Ising model.},

However, the interaction between the within individual dynamics of attitude formation and across person polarization is rarely studied. By modelling individual attitudes as Ising networks of attitude elements, and approximating this behaviour by the cusp singularity, we developed a fundamentally new model of social dynamics. In this hierarchical model, agents behave either discretely or continuously depending on their attention to the issue. At the individual level, the model reproduces the mere thought effect and resistance to persuasion. At the social level, the model implies polarization and the persuasion paradox. We propose a new intervention for escaping polarization in bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics.},
